# Smart Home System
## Smart Home system master MCU

### Description :
Master micro-controller for my smart home system project c programming language used to control temperature sensor, real time clock sensor, external eeprom, i2c master mode, and usart in asynchronous master mode.

### Requirements :
To build, compile and run this project successfully you need to use MPLAB X IDE with XC8 compiler, PIC18F46K20 8-Bit Micro-conroller, pickit3, Real Time Clock DS1307 time and date sensor, Temperature Sensor TC74, and EEPROM 24C02C external eeprom.

Also use the Smart Home Slave MCU Project with this project as it contains the DC Motor indicator configurations for the master MCU Temperature Sensor.

### Tools & Equipments Used :
1 - MPLAB X IDE

2 - XC8 Compiler

3 - PICKIT3

4 - PIC18F46K20 8-Bit Micro-controller

5 - Real Time Clock DS1307 time and date sensor

6 - Temperature Sensor TC74 

7 - EEPROM 24C02C external eeprom

8 - Internal I2C (IIC) or (I^2C) in master mode

9 - Internal EEPROM 

10 - Internal USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Tranceiver) in asynchronous master mode
